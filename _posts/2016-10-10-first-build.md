<h1 class="centered">Hello World!</h1>

<p>
Hello, my name is Matt. This is a test run for a blog format that will be running on my github site :)
</p>
<h2 class="centered">
This uses Jekyll's inbuilt blog post creation system. 
</h2>
<p>
Which allows me to seperate paragraphs easily, insert images and files inline with text, and also allow for easy to read code on the website such as:
</p>
{% highlight python %}
def beAwesome(person):
    if person.isAwesome == false: 
        person.isAwesome = true
        return "changed"
    else:
        return "skipped"
{% endhighlight %}
